```bash:
#!/bin/sh
# dc_copy_GPS.sh
# copy geotags (Exif GPS tag group) from one image to another.
# use: $ dc_copy_GPS.sh file1.jpg file2.jpg
#   It works only if either one of file1.jpg or file2.jpg is with GPS tags, and
#   another one does not have GPS geotags. You don't care about which is which.
#   This program automatically detects which one should be the source.
#   If both already have GPS tags, or both have no GPS tags, this program does nothing.
# note: This program works in Ubuntu Linux 16.04.
# note: You should install exiftool.
